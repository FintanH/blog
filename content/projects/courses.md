We'll post information here about when and where we are running that course, along with information about other upcoming courses.

If there is nothing posted here but you're interested in attending one of the courses that we run in the future, send an email to <a href="mailto:contact@qfpl.io">contact@qfpl.io</a>.

#### Introduction to Functional Programming

The main course that we run is the [Introduction to Functional Programming course](https://github.com/data61/fp-course).

The course aims to introduce functional programming to people who already have some exposure to programming.

Many people from around the world have worked through it on their own and found it to be valuable.
The course is self-contained but has been designed with personal guidance in mind - we recommend coming along to experience it that way if you have the chance.
