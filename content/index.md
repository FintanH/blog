# Queensland Functional Programming Lab


## What we are working on

Our team is committed to exploiting the benefits of Functional Programming, and
assisting others in doing same.

We have specific interests in:

* programming language tools and particularly legacy programming languages such
as python and javascript.

* numerical computing and associated tools.

* reflex as an implementation of Functional Reactive Programming.

* conducting hands-on Functional Programming courses, targetted toward industry
programmers who seek to take advantage of Functional Programming in their work.

See our [projects](./projects) for more.
