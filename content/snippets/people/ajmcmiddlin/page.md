Andrew likes solving problems with software, and _really_ likes doing it with functional
programming. One day he'll write a language. One day...

Andrew is also the programmer formerly known as Andrew McCluskey (or ajmccluskey), so if you see
that name around there's a good chance it's referring to this new and improved Andrew.
