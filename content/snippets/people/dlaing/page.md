Dave is a programmer working at the Queensland Functional Programming Lab.

He is interested in all kinds of things related to the theory, practice and teaching of functional programming and the various associated libraries, branches of mathematics, tools and folkore.

At the moment he is particularly interested in Nix (a functional package management system), reflex (a feature-rich functional reactive programming library), and diving deep into programming language theory to try to write better domain specific languages.
