Queensland Functional Programming Lab, a Data61/CSIRO and Queensland Government initiative, are running two free 3-day Functional Programming courses in Canberra, 18th to 20th July 2018. These workshops are: 

The well-known **Introduction to Functional Programming** course that has been run by Data61 for over 5 years. This course is targeted toward people who have some amount of programming experience, but little or no exposure to Functional Programming. 

The other is the **Applied Functional Programming** course. This is new course material that is targeted toward programmers who have become proficient with navigating Functional Programming concepts and would like to progress to building a complete application.

### Who should attend?

The Introductory course:

* Anyone who is interested in Functional Programming (FP) is encouraged to register. This course requires no prior experience with Functional Programming. However, general familiarity with the programming workflow (text editor, command line use, revision control) is important. 

The Applied course:

* Anyone that has completed the Introductory course, or consider themselves proficient and  comfortable with ``Applicative``, and are looking to use these skills to develop a larger application.
* If you can write the function with a type of: ``Applicative f => [f a] -> f [a]``.

Each session will be instructed by team members of the QFPL and you will be using the Haskell programming language to help you along your path of FP discovery.

### Key Outcomes

* you should be able to accurately describe the benefits of Functional Programming as they apply in practice.
* you should gain the confidence to continue exploring your own self-directed learning of Functional Programming.
* you should feel confident to seek out the necessary skills that are required to apply Functional Programming in your professional programming role.
* you will be shown the location of online (volunteer) peer support networks, for individuals who choose to continue self-study and require assistance from others to do so.

### Program Details

* **Date:** Wednesday 18 July 2018 – Friday 20 July 2018
* **Time:** 0900 – 1700 *(UTC+10)*
* **Location:** Synergy Building (Building 801), Dickson Way, Black Mountain ACT 2601 [map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=18/-35.27301/149.11379)
* **Cost:** Free.
* *morning and afternoon tea are provided*

### Requirements for participation

Participants will be required to bring a suitable development machine (e.g. portable laptop) for working through the exercises. You will also need to install the Glasgow Haskell Compiler ([http://www.haskell.org/ghc/](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/)) version 7.10 or higher on that machine.

You will require a copy of the course material github repository on your development machine:

For the Introductory Course:

* [https://github.com/data61/fp-course/](https://github.com/data61/fp-course/)
* There are no other primary requirements. However, reading up on Haskell syntax prior to the introductory material will be beneficial to progress.

For the Applied Course:

* [https://github.com/qfpl/applied-fp-course/](https://github.com/qfpl/applied-fp-course/)
* Working install of SQLite.

If there are any questions or concerns regarding the setup, please email fp-course@qfpl.io with the details.
