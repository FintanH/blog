As part of the Queensland Government of CSIRO’s Data 61 Strategic Partnership, we would like to offer you the opportunity for a free Functional Programming training course from the Queensland Functional Programming Lab at the Queensland Startup Precinct, delivered by Data61.

### Course Structure

The FP course is run over 3 consecutive days. The course is delivered by iterating on first a brief lecture on the new concept, followed by solving programming exercises related to that concept. The course runs at a relatively fast pace with accommodations to ensure that all participants are achieving the course objectives.

* Day One – We define Functional Programming, learn how to use the Haskell programming language, then explore the foundational concepts of Functional Programming

* Day Two – We take a non-trivial programming problem and solve it using our newly formed Functional Programming skills

* Day Three – Having built a foundational understanding, we explore the more advanced applications of Functional Programming and aim to apply those skills.

### Course Leader

Tony Morris, QFPL Team Lead

### Who should attend

The course is open and exclusive to Queensland Government employees who develop or maintain software. It is a fast-paced, hands-on course that is targetted toward those who seek to exploit Functional Programming for its technical advantages.

The initial course offering will be repeated in early September, and late September, with a limited number of 20 people per course. If there are any special requirements, or greater demand, please contact Tony and amendments can be made to suit tony.morris@data61.csiro.au 

### Where

The Queensland Startup Precinct

Level 2 TC Beirne Building, 315 Brunswick St, Fortitude Valley Q 4306.

### When

* 0900-1700, Tuesday 05-07 September 2017 *(limited to 20 people)*
* 0900-1700, Tuesday 25-27 September 2017 *(limited to 20 people)*

### Pre-requisites

Participants will be required to bring a suitable development machine (portable) for working through the exercises. That machine  will require:

* install Glasgow Haskell Compiler [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/) version 7.10 or higher on that machine.

* fork and clone the data61 FP course repository [https://github.com/data61/fp-course](https://github.com/data61/fp-course)
