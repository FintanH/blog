As part of the Queensland Government and CSIRO’s Data61 Strategic Partnership, we would like to offer the opportunity for a free Functional Programming training course from the Queensland Functional Programming Lab at [the Queensland Startup Precinct](https://qfpl.io/location/), delivered by Data61.

### Course Structure

The FP course is run over 3 consecutive days and is delivered by iterating on first a brief lecture on the new concept, followed by solving programming exercises related to that concept. The course runs at a relatively fast pace with accommodations to ensure that all participants are achieving the course objectives.

* Day One – We define Functional Programming, learn how to use the Haskell programming language, then explore the foundational concepts of Functional Programming

* Day Two – We take a non-trivial programming problem and solve it using our newly formed Functional Programming skills

* Day Three – Having built a foundational understanding, we explore the more advanced applications of Functional Programming and aim to apply those skills.

### Course Delivery

Tony Morris, QFPL Team Leader

### Who should attend

The course is open to anyone, with a view to target people who develop or maintain software in general. It is a fast-paced, hands-on course that seeks to demonstrate and apply the technical merits of Functional Programming.

Numbers are limited.

### Where

The Queensland Startup Precinct

Level 2 TC Beirne Building, 315 Brunswick St, Fortitude Valley Q 4006.

[https://qfpl.io/location/](https://qfpl.io/location/)

### When

* 0900-1700 AEST, 16-18 October 2017

### Pre-requisites

Participants will be required to bring a suitable development machine (portable) for working through the exercises. That machine will require the following:

* installed Glasgow Haskell Compiler [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/) version 7.10 or higher on that machine.

* fork and clone the data61 FP course repository [https://github.com/data61/fp-course](https://github.com/data61/fp-course)
